## Goals Achieved

### 1. Enhancing Meshery’s Playground UI & Test Coverage

I started the coding period with a focus on **Meshery Playground UI**—building new features and strengthening automated testing workflows. Using **Playwright**, I developed and optimized multiple end-to-end test scenarios. These efforts improved test reliability, reduced flakiness, and added broader UI coverage.

Key contributions:

* [#14388](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/14388)
* [#14195](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/14195)
* [#14333](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/14333)
* [#14372](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/14372)
* [#15207](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/15207)
* [#14749](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/14749)
* [#15040](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/15040)
* [#14476](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/14476)
* [#15237](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/15237)
* [#15175](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/15175)

These contributions largely shaped the **first half** of my coding period.

### 2. Contributions to Layer5 Academy (Second Half)

The **second half** of my GSoC journey shifted towards **Layer5 Academy**—a Hugo-based Learning Management System (LMS) designed to host interactive courses and labs.

I contributed to:

* **UI improvements and enhancements** across academies.
* **Content updates** for multiple academies.
* Cross-repo work in:

  * [layer5io/layer5-academy](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5-academy)
  * [layer5io/exoscale-academy](https://github.com/layer5io/exoscale-academy)
  * [layer5io/academy-theme](https://github.com/layer5io/academy-theme)

These contributions helped streamline content delivery and ensure consistency across the LMS ecosystem.

## Learnings & Takeaways

Throughout this journey, I significantly strengthened both technical and non-technical skills:

* **Technical Skills**

  * Deepened expertise in **Playwright**, writing scalable and optimized end-to-end tests.
  * Hands-on experience with **Hugo**, static site generation, and LMS development.
  * Improved understanding of **CI/CD pipelines** for testing and content deployment.

* **Community & Collaboration**

  * Improved code review, collaboration, and documentation practices.
  * Gained confidence in **leading discussions and helping newcomers onboard**.

---

## Ongoing Contributions & Community Involvement

My journey does not end with GSoC. Currently, I continue to contribute as:

* **Community Manager at Layer5**: Hosting weekly meetings, helping organize community events, inviting and onboarding new members, and fostering collaboration.
* **Active Contributor**: Continuing technical contributions to Meshery and Layer5 Academy.
* **Mentorship & Guidance**: Assisting newcomers in understanding project workflows, setting up environments, and making their first contributions.

I plan to stay actively engaged with Layer5 and Meshery, as the **learning opportunities, open culture, and mentorship environment are unmatched**.

---

## Future Work

*   Continuing contributions to **Meshery**, with a focus on expanding test coverage and implementing advanced scenarios.
*   Enhancing **Layer5's web properties**, including `cloud.layer5.io`, the main `layer5.io` site, and various academies.
*   Improving the **Layer5 Learning Management System (LMS)** through system design enhancements and documentation validation automation.
*   Actively engaging in **community management**, which includes mentoring newcomers and fostering a collaborative environment.
